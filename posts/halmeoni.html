  <h1>April 18, 2021</h1>

  <p>
    Yesterday my grandmother passed away. I received a text early yesterday that her health had taken a turn for the worse and that
    my dad and uncle had rushed to see her. Now, a day later, they have finished holding a wake (viewing the deceased) and are preparing a funeral.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Because I am in the U.S. I was not able to see her and say my final goodbye in person. I don't think any of my family really had a
    chance to say a proper goodbye since she was unconscious when this all happened, but we were all able to say what we could to her before she died.
    My sister held the phone for me.

    I feel bad that I could not be there. My grandmother was one of the first people to greet me into this world. According to a story (told many times by my mom at
    family gatherings) my grandparents had rushed to the hospital on receiving news that my mom was about to give birth to me. My grandmother had 
    arrived at the hospital in muddy rubber boots (the kind farmers wear in the countryside) and grabbed a hold of my dad when he arrived at the hospital
    and yelled '애비야 고추다 고추!' which means "it's a boy!" in the most direct way possible :) It was a good laugh for everyone hearing that story
    and maybe a little embarrassing for me at times, but I think ultimately it always made me happy to know that my entrance into this world was the cause
    for such joy for someone.

    My grandmother was always a quiet woman. I think she was the type to endure things in silence. But she endured not with repressed feelings or bitterness, but
    with an open heart, out of geniality and kindness. In Korean we would say that someone is '선하다' (a word that means both 'bright' and 'good'),
    and that was my grandmother exactly. It was so suprising last last year when I visited her with Katie and my family, she was smiling and talkative
    despite it being extremely difficult for her to speak with Parkinson's. She was very happy that I had met Katie, and as we were leaving she gave Katie a 
    tight hug and asked her to please "get married soon and have lots of healthy babies" xD

    That was the last time I saw her. I remember thinking that it might be my last time seeing her then so I remembered to tell her that I loved her.
    I'm overhwelmed right now because I know there will be a time when I have to say goodbye to other loved ones. Some day I will have to say goodbye to my parents,
    and for my dog Natto, I will have to say goodbye in just a few years. But I also feel it's an incredible blessing just to love and be loved by family.

    Just a moment ago I video-called all my relatives at the funeral and everyone was happy to see me, smiling and waving and saying hi and genuinely looking
    okay. It's been a long time since everyone came together like this and of course everyone was sad, but I would not say it was somber. In fact I think everyone
    was somewhat high-spirited to see each other again and reminisce on old times. It's what my grandmother would have wanted. I don't know if there
    is anything after this life or if there is such a thing as a soul, but I pray that my grandmother is well. 사랑해요 할머니.
