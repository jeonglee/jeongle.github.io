  <p>
    With the recent shenanigans in the stock market due to COVID-19 I became interested in economics. 
    I guess part of the reason I started reading "Debt: The First 5000 Years" is because I was curious about the origins of the economy we have today.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So what is economics? According to the book "Basic Economics" by Thomas Sowell, it's the study of the allocation of scarce resources with alternative uses. Today this whole idea is pretty clear, and it's easy to see
    how it applies to our daily lives. A simple example: grocers produce yogurt and ice cream with milk, so how should you allocate milk (which can alternately be used to make yogurt or ice cream) in an efficient manner?
    ("Efficient" can mean many things. I think economists like to think of it as "the maximum number of people getting the things they need given scarce resources," although
    the incentives of businesses may be to maximize profits).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the first few chapters of the book the ideas of supply and demand are introduced, along with what happens when you artificially limit prices (holding supply or demand constant).
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Increase in demand means an increase in price, followed by an increase in supply.</li>
    <li>Increase in supply means decrease in price, followed by an increase in demand.</li>
    <li>Decrease in demand means a decrease in price, followed by a decrease in supply.</li>
    <li>Decrease in supply means increase in price, followed by a decrease in demand.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>All of this is to say that eventually prices settle at some sort of equilibrium.</p>
  
  <p>
    One thing that made me curious though is where demand comes from. In a "free market economy" like in the US, supply seems to natural trail consumer demand.
    Since corporations seek to maximize profits, they try to find situations where demand exceeds supply (which means higher prices) and fill that gap.
    
    This isn't to say that demand is created independently. The whole point of marketing and advertising and brand promoting is to create consumer demand. 
    Also consumer demand may not be the only type of demand that drives the economy. Wars and government-driven projects will drive demand for all sorts of resources (often jump-starting the economy.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That being said, it was a revelation to me that consumer demand IS really the base of modern economics. The reason the US has such a large economy is due to its
    insatiable consumer demand - people living a life of constantly needing more and buying more. Not a lot of people stop to question their desires or where they came from.
    But as we saw in "Debt: The First 5000 Years", it is a system oftentimes put in place by governments seeking to maintain their power/finance military endeavors. Regardless of how this system of 
    insatiable consumer demand was created though, the fact that the basis of our economy is the average Joe remains unchanged.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The questions of "where will the economy go" or "how will the stock market behave" ultimately depend on what the average Joe spends money on. If the pandemic causes a 
    permanent downward shift in spending habits, this will result in less revenue for businesses, which translates to lower wages and even lower spending,
    until demand has virtually disappeared. Without something to reverse this downward spiral, the economy may enter a prolonged recession or depression.
