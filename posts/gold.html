    A week or two ago I watched an interview with Noam Chomsky on the coming presidential election. 
    A lot was said throughout the interview but the part that really stuck with me was when Noam Chomsky said (paraphrased):
    "This may be the most pivotal moment in U.S. history". 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What Chomsky is describing is the end of American democracy. If Trump loses the election there is a good chance
    he will denounce the results and refuse to leave office, something that has never happened (not in the states at least).
    It seems like a bad joke to imagine such a scenario unfolding but I believe it. Can you imagine Trump conceding defeat?
    He will do everything to keep his place and there will come a point where people have to take sides. If it really comes down to it
    there might have to be an intervention from the military.

    It's settling in that no matter the results of the presidential election the future does not look bright for this country.
    The Federal Reserve has already injected 3 trillion dollars in response to the pandemic - to put that into perspective they injected a roughly
    equal amount in the past 3 months as they have in the span of 6 years after the 2008 financial crisis. The U.S. was nowhere close to catching 
    up to that massive amount of debt when coronavirus struck. This massive injection has caused the stock market to flourish as wealthy individuals/entities 
    take advantage of the low interest rates and the flood of new money to buy assets. All the while consumers are forced to
    reduce their spending as they are laid off or save up in preparation for the uncertain future. The consumers that ultimately prop
    up the economy have been permanently hamstringed despite the new wealth companies have acquired through the stimulus, as many companies
    have no way of creating jobs for the duration of the pandemic. When the stimulus stops and the companies are on their own again, there will
    still be no way for them to survive as there will be not be enough consumers to support them.

    My question is - for how long can you keep printing money? What are the repercussions of continually injecting trillions into an economy
    whose wheels refuse to budge? Will it end in massive inflation once the money in the hands of companies finally flow down into the hands of
    individual consumers? Will there be a prolonged depression as no matter what companies do the majority of consumers will refuse to leave their
    slump? It's definitely something I need to learn more about.

    I may be off my rockers preparing for the end of the world like Gene Westover from 'Educated'. But my gut instincts have 
    been eerily accurate as of late. Earlier this year we had bought up N95 masks and a bunch of essential goods (including toilet paper lol) 
    before they disappeared from shelves. I was on the verge of converting a good chunk of my savings into gold when I convinced myself
    "this is pure speculation" and lifted my finger from the 'buy' button. Well, now that we've seen beyond a measure of doubt that absolutely
    anything is under control, I think the time is ripe to hit that button.
