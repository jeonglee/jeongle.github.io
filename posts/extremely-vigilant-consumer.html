  <h3>Current Events</h3>

  <p>
    Today I'm not entirely sure what to write about. A lot has transpired since the last time I wrote here but I don't feel like going into all the details.
    In terms of world events: Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump is calling it a hoax, coronavirus cases are skyrocketing in the US and
    around the world (around 200,000 daily cases and close to 3000 deaths daily as of this week), Moderna and Pfizer recently announced 95%+ effective vaccines,
    and the stock market is still raging on. What a mouthful.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Having said all that I guess it's hard not to talk about the stock market. Speaking with family I learned that the stock market craze has caught
    on in Korea as well. It reminds me of how a year ago bitcoin and cryptocurrency was all the rage. I heard my mom's friend (a housewife) bought some 
    200 grand worth of Tesla stock from borrowed money. They do own a reasonably successful business but going 200K into debt to buy TSLA just sounds like 
    pure gambling.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That's not to say that what she did was definitely a poor choice - TSLA and the stock market in general is in a craze so they probably saw their portfolio fatten up
    quite a bit. But given that this is most likely a bubble, chances are good that they are buying high. However there is definitely a sense of FOMO on my part and
    I can't deny I have the itch to speculate away. For now I'll satisfy myself with the knowledge that I've maxed out my 401K.

  <h3>Personal Stuff</h3>
  
  <p>
    Enough of the boring politics and stock market talk. It's weird that an ever increasing portion of my consciousness is dedicated to these topics. 
    I can't help but imagine myself becoming a gray old adult in a gray old suit going to some gray old cubicle all day for work; a pretty depressing 
    thought.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A friend recently asked me what I think is the meaning of life (yeah I know - it was very much out of left field for me too). The exact text was 
  </p>
  
  <b>
    "Dude, what is the meaning of your life? I admire your emphasis on leisure (and by association, self care). What is this all for ?"
  </b>
  
  <p>
    I thought it was amusing that he thinks I emphasize leisure in my life and that was the first thing that came to mind when he thought of me, 
    because that's not at all how I would describe myself. To give some background, we used to be coworkers and I always ate out for lunch.
    Not that I always splurged on fancy meals or anything - I think he was just a lot more intent on saving up. 
    To give an example we used to go out to this Thai place in Lower East Side for lunch. He discovered after one of our meals that they had actually charged him some 50 cents more on his meal
    than was listed on the receipt by checking his bank app. So I think maybe it's not so much that I'm a hedonist as he is an extremely vigilant consumer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Of course I didn't mention all this. I'm sure from his perspective he could list out all the times I wasted money on unnecessary foods and items - money
    that could have gone into some ETF or index fund or high yield savings account. Instead I gave it some serious thought (by serious I mean typing out a 
    text response for the next 10 minutes) and came up with a reply that goes something like this: "I think the best we can do is enjoy time with friends and family 
    by doing fun things and eating good food and having good conversations with them. Of course there is a part of me that wants more - but I'm not sure if 
    that's a product of living in today's achievement focused world or some innate human desire to become something greater."
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A vanilla response. It does capture what I think is important - but it doesn't quite highlight how strongly at odds I feel about how I 
    am living my life right now. That gray old cubicle isn't just a metaphor I guess. But when I think of all the choices laid out in front of me branching 
    out like so many splits in a road - I feel paralyzed by indecision. Choosing one road will mean abandoning all the others. So I plod along
    the same neat little path I am currently on.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A few days ago I asked my sister about this and in response she asked me what I would be doing if I only had a year to live. What a good answer.
