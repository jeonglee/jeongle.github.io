    I recently purchased a 1976 Yamaha XS400D motorcycle from Craigslist. The owner was a man in his late 70s who had ridden it for some time in his youth before
    covering it up and leaving it in his garage for close to 40 years.

    The bike is mostly in good condition - not a lot of rusting and the engine/electrical seem (at least externally) clean and undamaged. Of course like any bike
    that has been sitting around for 40 years it has its own host of problems that needs fixing, but that's partially why I bought it in the first place. So far
    I've cleaned up the bike a little, replaced the oil and oil filter, put in new spark plugs and battery, and sent the gas tank to be cleaned out. In the meantime, I've been
    Youtubing my way through the workings of a motorcycle and I think I finally get the gist of how it all works. Once the gas tank is back I'm going to try to 
    start up the bike and see if it runs/idles, and diagnose issues from there.

    One reason I think vintage Japanese bikes are so irresistible is their simplicity. Today's vehicles are so chock-full of software and proprietary components
    it would be extremely hard to diagnose and rebuild from scratch. Today's vehicles are undeniably better in terms of performance and efficiency, but they are orders
    of magnitude more complex. It reminds me of a saying I learned in school: "All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of abstraction."
    It's the idea that increasingly difficult problems are solved on the backs of other solutions, and it ends up with so many layers that it's often difficult to grasp how the whole thing works.
    One example would be the carburetor. The carburetor is a little device that mixes air and gas to deliver as fuel to the engine. It's entirely mechanical, and
    the underlying principle is fairly simple: low pressure sucks in fuel and air. Eventually carburetors were replaced by fuel injection systems which fed engines
    a more precise ratio of fuel and gas and at more precise intervals. These fuel injection systems turned into electrical fuel injection systems which are now controlled
    by sensors and CPUs.
