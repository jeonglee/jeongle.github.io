  <p>
    This past week I read a book called "Debt: The First 5000 Years" by David Graeber. It's an
    anthropologist's take on the history of debt and social exchange in general. There's a lot to
    absorb, so here's a summary:
  </p>
  <p>
    The book starts with a hot-take on the origins of money. We're taught in school that before
    money there was barter. If I'm a shoemaker in the age of pre-money, the way for me to get some
    potatoes is to make some shoes and exchange it for a sack of potatoes. The hot-take by Graeber
    is that this is unrealistic not only for obvious reasons (what if no one needs shoes at the
    moment?), but also because in all of history (modern and ancient) there have been no groups
    functioning strictly around barter.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what actually transpired in the age before dollar bills and coins? And why is it that barter
    came to be the primary explanation for the past?
  </p>

  <p>
    The answer to the first question is, simply put: credit. To put it into perspective, if I want
    potatoes then I go to Paul the farmer, ask him for some potatoes, and promise to pay him back
    later. It doesn't even have to be a concrete promise of what and when - as long as Paul trusts
    that I'll give something back in the future, all is good.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, this example is only a very small part of the picture. The idea of there being a
    shoemaker already assumes a lot of things - mainly that there are people specializing in the
    making of shoes. To get down to the essence of it all without having to assume some sort of
    preset background, a system for explaining all "types of exchange" is proposed:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Communistic: sharing things. If I ask you to pass the salt, would you say "what's in it for
    me?". Within any group of people there is an underlying assumption that certain things should be
    given freely, not because it necessarily results in immediate benefit to the giver, but because
    it is simply right to do so. A mother does not raise a child in anticipation of all the benefits
    they will gain from that child. Nor do children take care of their aging parents with the hopes
    of getting something back.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Reciprocity: an eye for an eye. This is the usual method when we think of exchange. I give
    you 5 bucks, you give me a Big Mac. The only socially acceptable method of exchange in this case
    is to give exactly as much as is received (and vice versa). Otherwise, debt is created on the
    basis of credit (trust that the debt will be paid back).
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Hierarchical: precedent. In situations where there is a power differential between two
    parties, precedent rules. If I give a child a lollipop the first few times I see them, they will
    probably expect to receive a lollipop whenever they see me. If I'm a king with vast armies, I
    can levy whatever taxes I want from my serfs, but the serfs will come to expect the same level
    of taxes next year round.
  </p>

  <h3>
    The advent of money
  </h3>
  <p>
    So how did physical money come into being? Let's start with kings and governments. How did kings
    and governments back in the day stay in power? They raised armies. How does one raise an army?
    Well you need food and equipment for the soldiers. Without money, you would have to tax your
    subjects for whatever your soldiers needed. Given the variety of needs it would have been a
    nightmare to consistently maintain and mobilize said army. What if you had money though? Instead
    of worrying what exactly your soldiers have to eat and wear, you can just pay them a stipend,
    with which they will go get food from your farmers, from whom you will tax money to give to your
    soldiers. Voila. Now, if you want a free peasantry instead of serfs/slaves kept in their place
    by force, you introduce merchants who will sell trinkets and goods you can purchase with money.
    When the incentives to buy those trinkets and goods becomes great enough, you have a "free"
    peasantry working, of their own accord, to make money.
  </p>
  <p>
    This may paint a bleak picture of the world (sound oddly familiar?), but indeed this is a system
    seen throughout history, especially among colonies of Western countries of the last millenia.
