    Maybe it's because we're nearing the end of the year but I'm feeling especially introspective. Yesterday it occurred to me - if I sleep 8 hours and
    work the usual 9-5, there's still 8 hours left in the day. It's an obvious statement, but one that feels surprising given how rushed I've felt
    on a daily basis for the past year. Chores up to the neck and no desire to do them. Even if I try to confine work from 9-5
    it always seems to spill over - even if I'm not sitting at my desk a portion of my mind is still thinking about it. And by the end of the week
    I'm completely scatter-brained without much space for anything.

    I had an occasion last month to wake up earlier than usual and I ended up using some of that time to read. I started Dune - a book that's been
    on my reading list for quite a while. It felt good to read. The story was gripping and I found myself looking forward to reading a little bit of it
    every morning. I think I've always suffered from feeling varying levels of guilt when enjoying anything. There's a voice in the back of my head that asks
    'Is it worth it?' But never have I felt guilty from picking up and enjoying a book. So when I was reading Dune, I felt very content - like I was 
    home where I belong.

    After finishing Dune I started reading Kafka by the Shore by Haruki Murakami. A super twisted/fantastical novel about spirits and prophecies. 
    Murakami has a talent for creating incredibly likeable characters that you can't help but falling in love with for their flawed yet wonderfully mature personalities. 
    It makes you wonder if there really are such romantic people out there in this world. They seem so relatable in their struggles but possess a
    purpose and conviction you rarely see in real life.

    Another thing I thought of reading Kafka by the Shore is how sophisticated Murakami himself is. I can't help but imagine him as a character in one of his own
    novels. Complicated and deeply insightful - to such a degree that you question whether he's real. How can one man have accumulated so many experiences and
    thoughts in one lifetime?
  </p>

    In any case I'm going to try to keep up this habit of reading a little bit every morning. I've mentioned this to people close to me but whenever I
    pick up and start reading a book - any book - I find that it answers many questions I have at the time. Sometimes it just brings the questions to 
    the surface, which is just what I need to start answering them.
