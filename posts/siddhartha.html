  <h3>Siddhartha</h3>

  <p>
    So far this year I've been able to keep up my habit of reading a little bit each morning. I visited a used-books store with Katie as a date of sorts and came
    home with an armful of books. Since then I've read four of them - Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, Business Adventures by John Brooks, Aphrodite by Pierre Louys, and Hamlet by Shakespeare. 
    Siddhartha is the second book I read by Herman Hesse, the first being Demian, a book considered a classic in Korea but not so well known in the states. 
    Although it was a long time ago that I read Demian (maybe 2016?) I remember being totally absorbed by the character and his troubles. I wondered whether Hesse 
    had written parts of the story from experience - otherwise how could he describe so vividly the mind and emotions of the young protagonist, and so believably at that? 
    I'm not sure I could even recall my own childhood experiences so well.

    Siddhartha is the story of a young Brahmin seeking enlightenment. Not satisfied with the teachings of his father (also a Brahmin) and his teachers, he strikes out
    to find his own way. He trains with ascetics, meets and converses with the Buddha, lives many years submerged in materialism and greed,
    and finally settles down working as the partner of a wise ferryman. Though he feels that he is no closer to enlightenment than when he had first left to find it, 
    he eventually comes to understand, through the sum of his experiences, that all things are a cycle. The flowing river is at once a droplet in the ocean and snow on the mountain. 
    His love for his son and the pain he feels when he must let go of him is the love and pain his father felt for Siddhartha when he himself had left.

  <em>
    “The world, Govinda, is not imperfect or slowly evolving along a long path to perfection. No, it is perfect at every moment; every sin already carries grace within it, 
    all small children are potential old men, all sucklings have death within them, all dying people -- eternal life. It is not possible for one person to see how far another is on the way; 
    the Buddha exists in the robber and dice player; the robber exists in the Brahmin.”
  </em>

    To see something not just for what it is, but what it may have been and what it may yet be - that is true understanding and enlightenment. It's a beautiful 
    philosohpy.
  </p>

    Funny enough I was reminded at many points of Hamlet and the many silly things he says - most notably of earthworms and kings.
  </p>
  
  <em>
    "Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he was converted)
    might they not stop a beer barrel? Imperious Ceasar, dead and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. O, that that earth which kept the world
    in awe, Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!"
  </em>
  
  <p>
    That part made me laugh. Another line:
  </p>
  
  <em>
    "We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes, but to one table; ...
    A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm."
  </em>
  
  <p>
    So I suppose in the context of Siddhartha, a king is at once a worm, beggar, fish, and bunghole in the eternal cycle.
