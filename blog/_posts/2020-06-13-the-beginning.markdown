The first of hopefully many posts.

While serving in the military (2013~2015) I found it really helpful to keep a journal. During a period where I felt my freedom was stifled and opportunities were lost I tried my best to grow and keep my hopes alive. Ironically those two years turned out to be some of the most fruitful.

I'm not sure if those journals are still around somewhere. If they are it sure would be nice to flip through them and see what was going on in my 20 year old bald head. Might as well start now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
