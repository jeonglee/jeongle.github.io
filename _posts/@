ELKR stands for ElasticSearch + Logstash + Kibana + Redis.
It's a set of open source tools that we can use to create a fairly efficient and scalable system for log analysis.

Since everything is open source this is a great resource for startups to systematically analyze their logs.

<h1> Introduction </h1>
To get an idea of how this system works, here is a description of the tools we'll be using:

<h2> ElasticSearch </h2>
ElasticSearch is the database that we'll be using to analyze our logs. By properly indexing the logs we acquire, we'll be able to query and find out relevant information regarding our logs using ElasticSearch.

<h2> Kibana </h2>
Kibana works with ElasticSearch to visualize relevant information regarding our logs. For example, if we can query logs based on time in ElasticSearch, Kibana will yield a bar chart that displays the log count with respect to time.

<h2> Logstash </h2>
Logstash is the tool we'll be using to 'gather' and 'send' logs from one place to another. 

<h2> Redis </h2>
Redis queues the logs before they are sent to ElasticSearch, in case of spikes in traffic.


Now, how do these tools work together?

In this model we gather the logs from a web server, ship those logs to Redis for queuing, and send them to ElasticSearch/Kibana for analysis.
